<h1>BHQ Job ignores Dotan &amp; Breuer</h1>
<p>Like many students of Tanakh, I started out in the cult of <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. I
thought <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> was <b>the</b> definitive edition. Unlike many students
of Tanakh, I eventually soured on <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, for the following
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It often fails to accurately transcribe μL (the Leningrad Codex).</li>
<li>It often fails to note where μL disagrees with other manuscripts.</li>
<li>It emphasizes manuscript quantity over quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>My first candidate for a <abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr> alternative was
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> (Biblia Hebraica Quinta). (Though I had soured on
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>, I still hadn’t fully escaped its cult.)</p>
<p>But I soon soured on <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> as well. I was dismayed to find that
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> will not be complete for many years. Perhaps more importantly, I
found that <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> still suffers from some of the same problems as
<abbr class="small-caps">BHS</abbr>. Although <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> now emphasizes
manuscript quality over quantity, the other two problems listed above remain, albeit to a lesser
degree.</p>
<p>I continued my search for better editions, and I was fortunate to find some. This made me even
more disappointed with <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>, in retrospect. I can see why something
like a fresh transcription of μL was beyond the scope of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. But I
can’t see why <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> would neglect the work already done in other
editions. These other editions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>דעת מקרא (Breuer et al., 1970&thinsp;–&thinsp;2003)</li>
<li><abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> (Dotan, 2001)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first volume of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> (Megilloth) came out in 2004. All but a
few volumes of דעת מקרא came long before that. Even Dotan’s <abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> was
available in plenty of time to be used in all volumes of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. Before
he died, Dotan was even a consultant for <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. What’s more, his
<abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> is sometimes used as a source in
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>. So it is particularly puzzling that his
<abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr>, in particular its monumental Appendix A, was not used (or was
not thoroughly used) in <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr>.</p>
<p>Although it may already be clear, I should explicitly state that my purposes are narrowly focused
on the Masoretic text. Thus I am not concerned with the many parts of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> that deal with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>sources in languages other than Hebrew</li>
<li>non-Masoretic (e.g. unpointed) Hebrew sources</li>
<li>Masorah magna and parva</li>
<li>the meaning of the text</li>
</ul>
<p>For all I know, those parts of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> are of high quality. But those
parts are not my concern.</p>
<p>Having criticized <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> in general terms, I will now review the
specifics of the <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> Book of Job. As of now, it is the latest volume
of <abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> to be published. First, the good news: the Job volume of
<abbr class="small-caps">BHQ</abbr> catches some quirks in μL that were missed by both
<abbr class="small-caps">BHL</abbr> Appendix A and דעת מקרא. They are as follows:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr id="row-17v6">
<td><a href="job1_details.html#row-17v6">#</a></td>
<td lang="hbo" dir="rtl">וְתֹ֖פֶ<span style="color: red">תּ</span><br>
וְתֹ֖פֶ<span style="color: green">ת</span></td>
<td>17:6</td>
<td>final ת has דגש</td>
</tr>
<tr id="row-17v11">
<td><a href="job1_details.html#row-17v11">#</a></td>
<td lang="hbo" dir="rtl">לְבָ<span style="color: red">בִּֽ</span>י׃<br>
לְבָ<span style="color: green">בִֽ</span>י׃</td>
<td>17:11</td>
<td>second ב has דגש</td>
</tr>
<tr id="row-18v9">
<td><a href="job1_details.html#row-18v9">#</a></td>
<td lang="hbo" dir="rtl">בְּ<span style="color: red">עָּ</span>קֵ֣ב<br>
בְּ<span style="color: green">עָ</span>קֵ֣ב</td>
<td>18:9</td>
<td>ע has דגש</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Each entry above takes the following form:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr>
<td>#</td>
<td><span style="color: red">μL</span><br>
<span style="color: green">consensus</span></td>
<td>c:v</td>
<td>how μL differs from consensus</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li># (hash sign) (number sign) is a link to more details on this quirk</li>
<li>μL is the contents of the Leningrad Codex (or a good guess of it)</li>
<li>consensus is the Masoretic consensus reading (or a good guess of it)</li>
<li>c:v is the chapter and verse of the book of Job</li>
</ul>
