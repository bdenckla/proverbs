<h1>BHQ: Too Little, Too Late</h1>
<p>Like many students of the Hebrew Bible, I was initially in the cult of BHS: I thought its was
<b>the</b> definitive edition of the Hebrew Bible. Unlike many students of the Hebrew Bible, I
eventually discovered many shortcomings of BHS, and began to look for better editions. Such is the
power of the cult that the first alternative I looked into was BHQ (Biblia Hebraica Quinta). I was
only bold enough to look outside of the cult of BHS, not outside of the cult of DBG (Deutsche
Bibelgesellschaft).</p>
<p>What I found was that, for my purposes at least, BHQ was too little, too late. It was too little
in two senses: many books of the Bible were not done, and those that were done did not substantially
improve on BHS. It was too late in the sense that even when the first volume of BHQ came out
(Megillot, 2004), better, complete editions were already available from other publishers.</p>
<p>I have said that for my purposes BHQ was too little, too late. But I have not yet said what my
purposes are. My purposes are narrowly focused on the Masoretic Text. I am not concerned with the
many parts of BHQ that deal with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>sources in languages other than Hebrew,</li>
<li>non-Masoretic (e.g. unpointed) Hebrew sources,</li>
<li>Masorah magna and parva,</li>
<li>the meaning of the text, in any language</li>
</ul>
<p>For all I know, these parts of BHQ are of the highest quality, and improve greatly on BHS. But
these parts are not my concern.</p>
<p>This document discusses the BHQ edition of the Book of Job, focusing on its treatment of certain
textual variants. Right now it consists merely of this <a href="./job1_overview.html">document</a>,
“Book of Job (ספר איוב) Document 1 - Overview.”</p>
